# Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM)

Example RBM coded in PyTorch and trained to be a movie recommendation system.

The model was trained using [The Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset) from Kaggle. In particular, two files were used: ```ratings_small.csv``` and ```movies_metadata.csv```.
